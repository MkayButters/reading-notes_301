 ## Node.js on sitepoint.com

1. Node.js is defined different ways by different people;
 - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
 - Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

2. Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine.

3. Node can be installed via Ubuntu Terminal.

4. Node has various build tools, these build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

5. Node.js allows us to run JavaScript on the Server
 
6. Some developers also dislike the callback-based style of coding that JavaScript imposes (so much so that there’s even a site dedicated to the horrors of writing asynchronous JavaScript). But with the arrival of native Promises, followed closely by async await, flow control in modern JavaScript has become easier than it ever was.
 
7. Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration. It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven or for sites involving data streaming.

8. Aside from speed and scalability, an often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server — as well as in the browser — is that your brain no longer needs to switch modes. You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive (and hopefully, happier). For example, you can easily share code between the server and the client.
