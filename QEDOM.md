 - JQuery, when used properly can make coding simpler. Their motto is _"Write less, do more."_

 - When multiple elements are selected a JQuery object is returned, also known as a matched set or jquery selection.

 - Some JQuery methods both retrive information from, and update the contents of elements. But they dont always apply to all elements.

 - When a selection is created with jQuery, it stores a reference to the corresponding nodes in the DOM tree, it doesnt create copies of them.

 - A jQuery object stores references to elements in a variable.

 - With jQuery updating a selector that returns multiple elements, you can update all of them using one method.

 - Chaining can also be done when using more that one jquery method on the same selction of elements using the `.` notation.

- jQuery's `.ready()` method checks that the page is ready for code to work with.

1. `.html()`
    - This method gives every elmeent in the matched set the same new content.
2. `.text()`
    - This method gives every element in the matched set the same new text content.
3. `.replaceWith()`
    - This method replaces every element in a matched set with new content.
4. `.remove()`
    - This method removes all of the elements in the matched set.

## 6 reasons for Pair Programming

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.

Why should I consider pair programming in coding?

1. Greater Efficiency;
    - Easier to catch mistakes, and higher quality code

2. Engaged Collaboration;
    - The experiance is more engaging and the programers are more focused than if they were working alone.

3. Learning from fellow students;
    - I am far from knowing everything and i assume most people in the class are on the same level, so its easy to learn from others and to learn from yourself at the same time by showing others.

4. Social Skills;
    - It develops social skills and communication outputs for both you and your partner to develop speaking up and talking with each other.

5. Job Interview Readiness;
    - For most roles in the software field the ability to work with and learn from other are as important to a company than specific technical skills.

6. Work Environment Readiness
    - Many compainies utilize the pair programing so its good to hit the ground running!
